# logos

Public home for logos and icons used by my private projects, so they can be
referenced by URL from places like Unraid Docker templates.

## Usage

Reference a file by its raw URL:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/some-data-guy/logos/main/<path-to-file>
```

For an Unraid container, paste that URL into the **Icon URL** field
(advanced view) of the container template.

## Tips

- PNG or SVG with a transparent background works best; square, around 256×256.
- One folder per app, with files named `icon_<width>x<height>.png`,
  e.g. `my-app/icon_192x192.png`.
